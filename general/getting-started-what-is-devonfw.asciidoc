image::images/devonfw-small.png[,align="center",width="200",devonfw, link="images/devonfw-small.png"]

Welcome to *devonfw*, the devonfw platform. This is a product of the CSD industrialization effort to bring a standardized platform for custom software development within Capgemini APPS2. This platform is aimed at engagements where clients do not force the use of a determined technology so we can offer a better alternative coming from our experience as a group.

http://www.devonfw.com[devonfw] is a development platform aiming for standardization of processes and productivity boost, that provides an architecture blueprint for Java/JavaScript applications, alongside a set of tools to provide a fully functional _out-of-the-box_ development environment.

Please note that the _devonfw_ name is a registered trademark of image:images/Capgemini_Logo_Small.png[,width="95", Capgemini, link="https://www.capgemini.com/"].

== Building Blocks of the Platform

devonfw uses a state-of-the-art open source core reference architecture for the server (today considered as commodity in the IT-industry) and on top of it an ever increasing number of high-value assets that are developed by Capgemini.

== devonfw Technology Stack

devonfw is fully Open Source and consists of the following technology stacks.

=== Back-end solutions

- https://github.com/devonfw/devon4j[_devon4j_]: server implemented with Java. The devonfw platform provides an implementation for Java based on https://spring.io/[Spring] and https://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/[Spring Boot].

- https://github.com/devonfw/devon4net[_devon4net_]: server implementation based on https://dotnet.microsoft.com/[.NET].

- https://github.com/devonfw/devon4node[_devon4node_]: server implementation based on https://nestjs.com/[NestJS].

=== Front-end solutions

For client applications, _devonfw_ includes two possible solutions based on _TypeScript, JavaScript, C# and .NET_:

- https://github.com/devonfw/devon4ng[devon4ng]: Frontend implementation based on https://angular.io/[Angular] and hybrid mobile implementation based on https://ionicframework.com/[Ionic].

- https://github.com/devonfw/devon4x[devon4X]: Mobile implementation based on https://docs.microsoft.com/xamarin/[Xamarin].

== Custom Tools

=== devonfw IDE

The `devonfw-ide` is the new and fantastic tool to automatically download, install, setup and update the IDE (integrated development environment) of your _devonfw_ projects.

==== IDEs

It supports the following IDEs:

* link:eclipse[Eclipse]
* link:vscode[Visual Studio Code]
* link:intellij[IntelliJ]

==== Platforms

It supports the following platforms:

* link:java[java] (see also https://github.com/devonfw/devon4j/wiki[devon4j])
* link:cs[C#] (see https://devon4net.github.io/[devon4net])
* link:node[node].js and link:ng[angular] (see https://github.com/devonfw/devon4ng/wiki[devon4ng])

==== Build-Systems

It supports the following build-systems:

* link:mvn[mvn] (maven)
* link:npm[npm]
* link:gradle[gradle]

However, also other IDEs, platforms, or tools can be easily integrated as link:cli#commandlet[commandlet].

=== CobiGen

_CobiGen_ is a code generator included in the context of _devonfw_ that allows users to generate all the structure and code of the components, helping to save a lot of time wasted in repetitive tasks.

Following the same philosophy CobiGen now bundles a new command line interface (CLI) that enables the generation of code using few commands. This feature allows us to decouple CobiGen from Eclipse and be able to use it alongside VS Code or IntelliJ.
