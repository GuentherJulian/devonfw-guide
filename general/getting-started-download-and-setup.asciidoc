= Download and Setup

In this section, you will learn how to setup the devonfw environment and start working on first project based on devonfw.

The devonfw environment contains all software and tools necessary to develop the applications with devonfw.

== Prerequisites

In order to setup the environment, following are the prerequisites:

* Internet connection (including details of your proxy configuration, if necessary)
* > 1GB of free disk space to install customized environment
* The devonfw IDE CLI installed

== Download
IMPORTANT: Please refer to the link:setup[devonfw IDE] documentation for the **current installation process**.

Older devonfw distributions can be obtained from the http://de-mucevolve02/files/devonfw/[FTP releases library] and are packaged in a _zip_ file that includes all the needed tools, software and configurations. Browse to the corresponding version folder in order to get the latest version. 

=== Setup the workspace for older versions

1. Unzip the devonfw distribution into a directory of your choice. *The path to the devonfw distribution directory should contain no spaces*, to prevent problems with some of the tools.

1. Run the batch file "create-or-update-workspace.bat".

This will configure the included tools like Eclipse with the default settings of the devonfw distribution.

The result should be as seen below

[start=3]

*The working devonfw environment is ready!!!*

*Note* : If you use a proxy to connect to the Internet, you have to manually configure it in Maven, Sencha Cmd and Eclipse. Next section explains about it.

=== Setup the workspace  for older versions (Linux)

* Unzip the devonfw distribution into a directory of your choice. *The path to the devonfw distribution directory should contain no spaces*, to prevent problems with some of the tools.

* Run the script: . env.sh

* Run the script: . create-or-update-workspace

image::images/download-install/create_update_ws.png[, width="550", create_update_ws, link="images/download-install/create_update_ws.png"]

These both . env.sh and . create-or-update-workspace will set all the softwares path that included with devon distribution like eclipse, maven , java etc. Also this will generate some file like eclipse_main used to invoke eclipse

* For vscode setup we have to execute create-or-update-workspace-vs

* There are a scripts initialize.sh and uninstallUI.sh.
** initialize.sh : It installs angular,node, python ant subversion
** uninstallUI.sh : It is use to uninstalls the above softwares
