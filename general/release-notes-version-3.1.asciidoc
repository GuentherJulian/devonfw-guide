==== AppSec Quick Solution Guide
This release incorporates a new Solution Guide for Application Security based on the state of the art in OWASP based application security. The purpose of this guide is to offer quick solutions for common application security issues for all applications based on devonfw. It’s often the case that we need our systems to comply to certain sets of security requirements and standards. Each of these requirements needs to be understood, addressed and converted to code or project activity. We want this guide to prevent the wheel from being reinvented over and over again and to give clear hints and solutions to common security problems.

==== CobiGen
* CobiGen core new features:
** CobiGen CLI: Now you can use CobiGen within the devonfw console. For the first time.
*** Performance improves greatly in the CLI thanks to the lack of GUI.
*** You will be able to use path globs for selecting multiple input files.
*** We have implemented a search functionality so that you can easily search for increments or templates.
** First steps taken on CobiGen refactoring: With the new refactoring we will be able to decouple Cobigen completely from the target language/format and input language/format. This will facilitate the creation of parsers and mergers in any language.
*** NashornJS has been deprecated: It was used for executing JavaScript code inside JVM.
*** 
** Added the possibility to reference external increments on configuration level. This is used for reducing the number of duplicated templates.
* CobiGen_Templates project and docs updated: 
** Spring standard has been followed better than ever.
** Interface templates get automatically relocated to the api project. Needed for following the new devon4j standard.
* CobiGen Angular:
** Angular 8 generation improved based on the updated application template.
** Pagination changed to fit Spring standard.
* CobiGen Ionic: Pagination changed to fit Spring standard.
* CobiGen OpenAPI plugin released with multiple bug-fixes and other functionalities like:
** Response and parameter types are parsed properly when they are a reference to an entity.
** Parameters defined on the body of a request are being read correctly.
